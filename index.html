            Tower Bridge is a Grade I listed combined bascule and suspension
            bridge in London, built between 1886 and 1894, engineered by John
            Wolfe Barry and architected by Horace Jones. The bridge crosses the
            River Thames close to the Tower of London and is one of five London
            bridges owned and maintained by the Bridge House Estates, a
            charitable trust founded in 1282. The bridge was constructed to give
            better access to the East End of London that had expanded its
            commercial potential in the 19th century, and was opened by the
            Prince of Wales and Princess of Wales.

          <p>
            The Natural History Museum in London is a natural history museum
            that exhibits a vast range of specimens from various segments of
            natural history. It is one of three major museums on Exhibition Road
            in South Kensington, the others being the Science Museum and the
            Victoria and Albert Museum.

            The museum is home to life and earth science specimens comprising
            some 80 million items within five main collections: botany,
            entomology, mineralogy, palaeontology and zoology.

          <h2>Borough Market</h2>
          <p>
            Borough Market is a wholesale and retail market hall in Southwark,
            London, England. It is one of the largest and oldest food markets in
            London, with a market on the site dating back to at least the 12th
            century. The present buildings were built in the 1850s, and today
            the market mainly sells speciality foods to the general public.
          </p>
          <p>
            A market that originally adjoined the end of London Bridge was first
            mentioned in 1276, although the market itself claims to have existed
            since 1014 "and probably much earlier"[ and was subsequently moved
            south of St Margaret's church on the High Street.
